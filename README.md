## Project Overview

This project is for our 4th semester Aerospace Engineering course.

**Title:** ROS-Enabled Design and Implementation of an Intelligent Autonomous Aeroplane  

**Goal:** Build a small-scale autonomous VTOL RC plane using **Pixhawk + Raspberry Pi**, capable of:
- Automatic takeoff and landing  
- Stable flight and waypoint autopilot  
- Live HD video streaming to a ground station  
- Basic obstacle detection and avoidance  
- Weekly documented progress on GitHub (code + tests + reports)

## Linked Repository

All source code, wiring diagrams, and reports will be stored in this repo:

➡ **Main repo:** `sujeetsamal/vtol-quadplane-raspberrypi-pixhawk`

(Once the repo is ready, I will add the full README, BOM, and design documents there.)

## How I Will Use This Project Board

- **Backlog:** Ideas and tasks not started yet  
- **Ready:** Tasks planned for this week  
- **In progress:** Work currently being done  
- **In review:** Tasks waiting for testing or teacher review  
- **Done:** Finished tasks (with date and short note)

I will:
- Update the board **every week**  
- Create an item for each major task (hardware, software, testing, documentation)  
- Move items across columns as the project progresses

## Weekly Status

Week 1:
- Set up GitHub repo and project board  
- Finalize system architecture and component list  

(Each week I will add a short status summary here.)
